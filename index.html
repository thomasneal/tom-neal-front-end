          <ul>
            <li>
              Customer wanted new app to match features of current version
              (v10), but could not provide access to the source code (only had
              access to v6)
            </li>
            <li>Vague requirements and limited subject matter expertise</li>

              Customer's environment was secure and did not have access to the
              internet (approved packages/libraries only)
            </li>
            <li>
              Customer had extensive onboarding requirements to allow the team
              access
            </li>

              Strict deadline and customer delays shortened work timeline from
              months to weeks

            <p>Result - I was able to deliver and deploy the package on time</p>
            <p>
              I had to balance my time between leading the project and
              completing my own deliverables. I think what led to my success
              here was being very organized and methodical in my approach. I
              utilized Jira to help develop the plan for the project ensuring
              that we were working through the stories in the most efficient way
              and wouldn't get blocked by missing dependencies. I also found
              that it was critical to identify the best package to use for each
              feature.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many things to consider when choosing the right package.
              I always start with reviewing the approved packages and then look
              outside if there isn't a good fit, followed by developing my own
              solution. The key takeaway I had here was in managing my time.
              There were some scenarios where I was able to use the existing
              approved packages and repurpose items to fit the current need, but
              there were other scenarios where in the end the best option was do
              develop my own solution. In the future, I would approach this by
              identifying any gaps to each option, so I can rule things out
              quickly that won't work and identify the best option.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like to solve problems on my own and so I don't mind taking the
              time to research and dig into issues to find a solution, however
              with customer deadlines and budgets, that is not always realistic
              and so I knew in this specific project that I would have to
              utilize the team efficiently and so one of the things I did was
              pair developers together with complementary skills to pair program
              and find solutions faster. For example, I partnered with my right
              hand developer on layout issues because I had a stronger
              background in CSS and he also helped me solve an issue with React
              Query that I had encountered. This was way more efficient and also
              boosted both of our skill sets at the same time.
